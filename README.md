**UUXR** - XR for University Students in the Future: a group project for the course "Human-Centered Design" where students helped a customer company (Solita) design an MVP related to extended reality (XR) in a student environment. Our end result was UUXR, XR glasses for students that also works as a virtual assistant to improve studies.

Group project by Human Product Developers: Paavo Keski-Orvola, Tommi Laaksonen, Helen Konttinen, Allan Li, Kseniia Tarasova (2023).
